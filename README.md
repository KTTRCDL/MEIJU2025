# My implementation of MEIJU2025 baseline, variant datasets and models

reference: [MEIJU2025 baseline](https://github.com/AI-S2-Lab/MEIJU2025-baseline)

## Usage
See scripts in `scripts` folder.
run `whole_train` series scripts to pretrain-train-test the model.

## Feature
* variant datasets for multimodal features
* variant models for multimodal features

## Some tips:
using gcc-9 and g++-9 to compile the openface code in ubuntu, and using multiprocess to extrace visual feature (it really save time).
